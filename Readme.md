Basic Typescript commands
-------------------------
1. `npm i -g typescript` to install the typescript globally in our system
2. `tsc index.ts` to compile the typescript file and convert it to a javascript file as tsc is the compiler
3. `tsc index.ts -w` to automatically watch any changes while compiling and converting the file to js
4. `tsc -init` to create a config file for typescript to set the root and output directory 
5. `src` for root directory and `dist` for output directory
